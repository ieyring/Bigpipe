Bigpipe v.3.8
==============

Fast, solid and lightweight implementation of Facebooks Bigpipe. It support all browsers - included older versions.
Internet Explorer 6 & 7 included.

It works right out of the "box" and shouldn't give you any trouble.

In v.2.6, I added a error fallback handler in the script, so if something goes wrong, you can redirect the users 
to whatever website or page you want.

Take a look in the example.php for how it works, and if you still not understand. Send me a email and I 
promise to give you an answer before it has gone 6 hours.

I will not use any more time on this repo for now, but feel free to contribute if you have ideas for 
improvments.
