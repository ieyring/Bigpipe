Bigpipe v.1.5
==============
=======
Bigpipe v.2.0 - under construction
=================================
>>>>>>> origin/2.0-under-development

Working on a better version with a improved performance.

<<<<<<< HEAD
I tried to keep it as simple and small as possible, and I attached a example.php so you better
can understand how to use it.

Be aware that not all browsers have a console such as Firebug, so you may have to uncomment this lines.

Bigpipe v. 2.0 is under development - see the other branch. Cross-browswer DOM functionality added there


TODO:

1. Fix it so scripts that are needed by the page but do not need to be loaded before executing pagelets can be delayed and be requested when the pageletsâ€™ scripts are.
2. Manage dependencies between scripts
3.  Avoid double insertion. If two pagelets require the same script, it is only necessary to request once.
4. Manage pagelets reources in a unique place. 

 

		
=======
Main focus is to include this:

1. Load each pagelet in a iframe so the code is isolated from the rest of the page
2. Refreshing content in a single iframe pagelet on load
3. Injection inline CSS and JS

But I have no time at the moment to fix this.
