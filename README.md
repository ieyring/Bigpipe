Bigpipe v.2.0 - under construction
=================================

Working on a better version with a improved performance.

Main focus is to include this:

1. Load each pagelet in a iframe so the code is isolated from the rest of the page
2. Refreshing content in a single iframe pagelet on load
3. Injection inline CSS and JS
