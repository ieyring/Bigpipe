Bigpipe v.2.0
==============

Fast, solid and lightweight implementation of Facebooks Bigpipe. It support all browsers - included older versions.
Internet Explorer 6 & 7 included.

It works right out of the "box" and shouldn't give you any trouble.

Be aware that not all browsers have a console such as Firebug, so you may have to uncomment this lines in the script.

Take a look in the example.php for how it works, and if you still not understand. Send me a email and I promise a 
answer before 6 hours.

I will for a time now not use any more time on this repo, but feel free to contribute if you have ideas for 
inprovments.
