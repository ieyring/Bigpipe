Bigpipe
=======

Javascript implementation of Facebooks bigpipe. Works right out of the box. 

Finally I got time to finish up the 1.0 version.

I tried to keep it as simple and small as possible, and I attached a example.php so you better
can understand how to use it.

Be aware that not all browsers have a console such as Firebug, so you may have to uncomment this lines
before you use it.


TODO:

1. Fix it so scripts that are needed by the page but do not need to be loaded before executing pagelets can be delayed and be requested when the pageletsâ€™ scripts are.
2. Manage dependencies between scripts
3.  Avoid double insertion. If two pagelets require the same script, it is only necessary to request once.
4. Manage pagelets reources in a unique place.
